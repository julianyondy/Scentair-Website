            When a Disney Imagineer was tasked with adding scent to a few popular attractions, the idea of ScentAir was born. In 1994 we were founded on the notion that scent could turn a moment into a magical memory.

          <p className="text-lg text-white mx-auto max-w-4xl mt-6">
            By 2000 we were charting new territory, helping brands give their customers cutting-edge, scented experiences that deliver powerful ROI. Today, we're the world's leading provider of air purification and experiential fragrance for business and home. With offices on four continents and a diverse team of 500+ employees, we enhance environments in 119 countriesâ€”and create experiences worth sharing.
